# Starter kit to Publish react reusable component to npm in minute

## Installation

* Clone the repository and move into:
```console
$ git clone git@https://github.com/akfred/react-library-to-npm-starter-kit.git
$ cd react-library-to-npm-starter-kit
```
* Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

* Demo :

```console
$ npm start
```
You can now build your component, and create a demo for testing and showing it off.

 ```console
 src\   <- component source & styles
examples\src\  <- demo page 
 ```
## Publish your component to npm

If you do not have a npm account yet, you must create your account on [npm](npmjs.com) and log in to your npm account in the terminal ` $ npm login ` and publish

```console
$ npm publish
```
